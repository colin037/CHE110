        <h3><pre>
            Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that 
            replenish themselves over time, such as sunlight, wind, water, 
            geothermal heat, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable 
            energy sources do not deplete when used, and they produce 
            minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making them environmentally 
            friendly. Solar energy, for instance, captures the sun's energy
            through photovoltaic cells in solar panels, converting it into
            electricity. This form of renewable energy has grown in
            popularity due to its versatility, with applications ranging 
            from small-scale home systems to large solar farms. Similarly, 
            wind energy uses the kinetic energy of moving air to generate 
            electricity through wind turbines, which can be located onshore 
            or offshore. Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources, 
            owing to its high energy output and relatively low environmental impact.

        <b>Solar Energy:</b> This type of renewable energy harnesses energy from the sun. Solar power can be generated through photovoltaic (PV) panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, or through solar thermal systems, which capture and use heat from the sun. It's versatile and can be used in both large-scale solar farms and small-scale residential applications.

            <b>Wind Energy:</b> Wind energy is produced by harnessing the kinetic energy of wind through wind turbines. These turbines can be placed onshore or offshore, with offshore wind farms typically offering greater energy output due to more consistent wind patterns.

                    <b>Hydroelectric Power:</b> Also known as hydropower, this type of renewable energy uses the energy of flowing or falling water to generate electricity. Dams are commonly used to control water flow and create energy, but there are also run-of-the-river systems that don't require large reservoirs.
